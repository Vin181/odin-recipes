Add 3 food recipes to the website project using HTML

Three food recipes have been added to the website project using HTML. The recipes, which include ramen, omurice, and takoyaki, have been added to showcase HTML skills. Semantic HTML tags were used to structure the recipes, making the website more accessible. Images and descriptions were also added to each recipe to make them more appealing and informative. These changes will enhance the user experience of the website and demonstrate proficiency in HTML development.
