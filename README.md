Add 3 food recipes to the website project using HTML

In this commit, we have added 3 food recipes to the website project using HTML. The recipes include [insert recipe names], and they have been added to the website to showcase our HTML skills. We have used semantic HTML tags to structure the recipes and make the website more accessible. Additionally, we have added images and descriptions for each recipe to make them more appealing and informative. These changes will enhance the user experience of the website and demonstrate our proficiency in HTML development.
